Dear Ian,

 	Last month I decided to open source tth in its entirety. It is now on
source forge, including the flex source. sourceforge.net/projects/tth/

I propose that the Debian package should now depend upon that sourceforge
distribution. It contains a free license, which I mildly prefer to the MIT
license. If there's a strong reason that Debian objects to the license for tth
on sourceforge, please let me know and I'll consider what to do.

Also, I am abandoning the distinction between tth and tthgold, so no reduced
functionality package is included now.

Ian Hutchinson
Author of TtH

Hi,

Thank you for writing and making TtH freely available and for replying
promptly to my emails over the years. I am still the Debian
Organization's maintainer for its package tth.

For legal reasons Debian can only make software like TtH available for
all supported architectures and operating systems if free software
licenses are explicit and detailed. The shortest version of such a
license is the "expat" or "MIT" license.

In attached file expat.txt I have shown how the "expat" license
would look for TtH. Please consider renaming this as license.txt in the
next version of tth_C.tgz.

Dear Ian,

Thank you granting access to the TtH and TtM flex source at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/tth. I downloaded tth4_00.tar.gz and
followed your instructions in the file tth/README. It does indeed
compile working tth and ttm executables under Debian. I realize
you have spent thousands of hours writing and revising these
very useful programs.

There are a number of problems with your copyright license in the
file tth/README which would need to fixed before it would fully comply
with the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG). These are:---

1. Conflicting licenses in other files. My list of files with
   copyright license information is:

       tth/README
       tth/manual/ttm_manual.tex
       tth/manual/tth_manual.tex
       tth/manual/split/sec14.html
       tth/manual/split/tth_manual.html
       tth/ttmC/README
       tth/ttmL/README
       tth/TtMdir/readme.ttm
       tth/tthfunc/tars/tthdynamic/tth_manual.tex
       tth/tthfunc/tars/tthdynamic/tth_manual.html
       tth/tthgold/install.bat
       tth/tthgold/license.txt

   Ideally tth should have one license.txt file and wherever
   else you have a copyright claim you add the taglines:

   You may use this software only under the terms and conditions in
   the file license.txt originally included in the source tar file.

   If you have two licenses use different filenames and
   clearly identify which license applies to each file. Ideally
   one would have two separate tar if this were the case.

2. The copyright license should be titled "Copyright License"
   unless in a file on its own.

3. tth/README does not make it clear that the license applies
   to all software in the tth4_00.tar.gz file. What about ttm?

4. The word "freely" has many meanings. It is not clear which
   of these meanings applies.

5. The disclaimer in the second paragraph should be more general in
   who it covers and specific in what it covers against.

6. It has not been found compatible with the GPL which
   is a DFSG requirement.

7. Debian prefers the GPL version 3 as it extends free software and
   protects against software patent abuse but accepts many other
   boilerplate licenses as satisfying the DFSG. It has been tested in
   law courts of the USA and other countries and found to mean what is
   claimed.

Boilerplate like the Expat license takes the work out of drafting
a license which satisfies the DFSG.

Dear Ian,

Thank you for making all your TtH and TtM 4.01 software sources
available under the GNU General Public License version 2
(GPL-2). Debian considers that this license grants the four freedoms.
I will propose packages tth and ttm version 4.01 for installation in
Debian main/. Tth 4.00 is only available for i386. Tth and ttm 4.01
may initially appear for i386 in the sid distribution. They may be
modified and autobuilt eventually for all architectures and subsequent
distributions Debian and others such as Ubuntu and Redhat support.

I was able to download the current draft using:

 $ svn co https://tth.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/tth/trunk tth

and I noticed an inconsistent copyright license in file:

 	 tth/manual/split/tth_manual.html

Please replace this with a GPL-2 license before releasing tth4_01.tar.gz.

Hi again,

 	I have decided to release tth under the GPL-2. (Not 3)
I have modified the svn version on sourceforge (but not the tar, so don't get
that) to rationalize the licensing situation. To check it out do

svn co https://tth.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/tth/trunk tth

Please let me know if that satisfies your license needs. Thanks,

 	Ian Hutchinson

Dear Ian,
 I have downloaded tth 4.01 using:

 $ svn co https://tth.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/tth/trunk tth

and have made tth_4.01.orig.tar.gz on 27th February 2011 at 11.40 am
AEDT using:

 $ tar -cvzf tth_4.01.orig.tar.gz --exclude-vcs tth

and will commence the Debian packaging process based on
the file tth_4.01.orig.tar.gz created as you suggest.

Dear Ian,

Thanks for pointing out that spurious file. It's svn deleted now.
Thanks for your help in rationalizing the license situation.
Work from the svn repository version. It may take a while before I
get the tar finalized on sourceforge.
