Title: TtM - Converts TeX or LaTeX to HTML/MathML
Author: Ian Hutchinson
Abstract: TtM translates Plain TeX or LaTeX documents into HTML with
 equations in MathML. Fast and produces compact, editable and fast
 viewing web documents. Translates equations instead of converting
 them into images. The HTML preserves much format when imported by
 MS Word.
