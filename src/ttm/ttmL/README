TtM README file.
________________

This package contains the linux 2.x i386 distribution of TtM, a TeX to
(HTML and) MathML translator.

TtM is based on the highly successful TtH TeX to HTML translator. But instead
of using HTML tables for rendering mathematics, TtM uses MathML presentation
tags, embedded inside the <math> .... </math> construct.

Installation
____________

When you have the package downloaded on to your own disk,
extract the archive by executing 
	tar xzf ttmL.tar.gz
from the command line.

Enter the directory constructed, where you will find the extracted files
	cd ttmL

Install the program executables by executing from the command line
	./ttminstall

This will copy files to appropriate user directories (not system
directories). The directory $HOME/bin should be on the user's path,
but if not a warning will be given.

Running TtM
___________

The ttm executable was compiled with gcc and linked with libc6
(glibc).  However it is statically linked, so it should run on any
linux i386 system version 2.x. Static linking increases the size of
the disk file but does not impare operation.

Run TtM translation in the following ways; 

either from the command line type the command line:
	ttm >outputfile.html <inputfile.tex [switches]

or from the command line type 
	ttm inputfile [switches]

In the first case you can call the output file anything you want.  In
the last two cases an HTML file with the extension .html will be
created.

Read the manual ttm_manual.html with an HTML browser to find out more
details on how to run TtM.

The script file ps2gif is for image conversion.  It will be called
automatically by TtM when given the -e1 or -e2 switches. However,
ps2gif depends on your having a number of other utilities on your
computer. Most standard linux installations have these
utilities. Therefore, although we can take no responsibility
whatsoever for the utility of ps2gif, it will usually work. Similarly
the script latex2gif which depends on ps2gif and LaTeX will usually
work but again we cannot take responsibility for it.
