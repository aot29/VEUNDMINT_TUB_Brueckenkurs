To build the tth translator after unpacking the source archive on any 
linux (or probably unix) system, execute the command:
    $ make
This will generate an executable file named tthg.
It may be copied to your path, and possibly renamed. 

The other versions of tth and ttm may be compiled by the command:
    $ make tars
This will make a number of tar and zip archives in the directory tars/.
These can be transported to their required places and unpacked there.
If the system on which you are running does not have mingw installed,
then the MS Wind@ws versions will not be made. 

The user manual is in the directory manual/. The man page is tth.1 and may be
added to the system man pages.
