Linking the tex2x package statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on tex2x.
Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holders of tex2x give you permission to combine tex2x program
with free software programs or libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL and with independent
modules that communicate with tex2x solely through the interface variable exposed by the tex2x structure class
as defined in src/tex2Struct/structure.py. You may copy and distribute such a system following the terms
of the GNU GPL for tex2x and the licenses of the other code concerned, provided that you include the
source code of that other code when and as the GNU GPL requires distribution of source code and provided
that you do not modify the tex2x interface.

Note that people who make modified versions of tex2x are not obligated to grant this special exception
for their modified versions; it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU General Public License gives
permission to release a modified version without this exception; this exception also makes it possible
to release a modified version which carries forward this exception. If you modify the definition of
the structure interface variable, this exception does not apply to your modified version of tex2x,
and you must remove this exception when you distribute your modified version.

This exception is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version 3 (“GPLv3”)
