The course was developed within the scope of the VE\&MINT project.
\ \\ \ \\
VE\&MINT is a project cooperation of MINT-Kolleg Baden-Württemberg
with VEMINT-Konsortium, Leibniz Universität Hannover and Technische Universität Berlin which seeks to
offer a preparatory mathematical online course that is freely accessible nationwide based on a free licence,
and more generally to promote exchange of instructional material as well as software between its sites.
\ \\ \ \\
For further information on the online course and the project, see \MExtLink{http://www.ve-und-mint.de}{www.ve-und-mint.de}.

The English language/bilingual version of the course was developed at the TU Berlin with the specific goal to create a course
accessible and useful for refugees.
